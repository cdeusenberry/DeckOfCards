# DeckOfCards

A little test app for a deck of cards.

This is over engineered for what it is, but is an example of one way to structure a react native app.

## Sharing code with

This has [DeckOfCardsLib](https://github.com/cdeusenberry/DeckOfCardsLib) as a dependency. That code has zero dependencies on React Native and is also consumed at [DeckOfCardsWeb](https://github.com/cdeusenberry/DeckOfCardsWeb)

## Missing

Building blocks for constructing a UI. Should have files for Typography, Colors, Strings, etc. Then additional components, and styles, are built from these.

## Only ran on iOS Sim

This project hasn't been tested on Android at all, and on no real devices.
